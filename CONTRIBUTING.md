Anyone is welcome to contribute to this project.  Please make any pull requests to the development branch, and I will test any changes before mergins with the master.

Your contribution is welcome, but may not be added to the main project at my discretion.  For example, there are some features that I want to leave out for simplicity and ease-of-use.
If you disagree, you are encouraged to fork this project and continue on your own version, as long as you adhere to the attached license.

Thanks,

-Ian Kloo
