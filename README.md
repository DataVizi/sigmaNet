# sigmaNet

IN DEVELOPMENT

This is an attempt at an htmlwidget connecting R and sigma js.  While there is already a pre-existing library called sigma, this one is meant to be more full featured (the original library was built as a demonstration of the htmlwidgets framework and is no longer being developed).
